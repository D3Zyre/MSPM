When we first modeled the Raphael in MSPM, we used the 'Fin Connected Channels' heat exchanger.
Then Matthias fixed the code of the 'Fin Enhanced Surface" heat exchanger and used this type from there.

At first, the heat transfer between liquid and wall was simulated by an insulating body ('HXinsulated' in this folder).
Then the custom heat transfer coefficient was implemented into MSPM and used in the runs for Matthias' thesis ('Custom_h').
